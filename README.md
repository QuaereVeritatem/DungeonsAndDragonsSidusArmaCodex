# DungeonsAndDragonsSidusArmaCodex
This is an app that uses the awesome, D&amp;D API (http://www.dnd5eapi.co)to pull information about the weapons in the D&amp;D 5th edition game. This API/App includes basic weapons only.  This is part of a 4 part series of apps that will use the D&amp;D API. Look forward to the others coming soon!
